# SwapWise, an Alternative Supermarket Product Finder
Final project for Hasselt University in the Designing Interactive Systems course.

# Description
This project describes a smart application that helps consumers to quickly and easily choose the best product based on their personal preferences. By scanning products, both at home and in the store, the user immediately gains insight into where the exact product or suitable alternatives are available, along with a price comparison and other labels that are important to the user. In the store, the app also shows whether a better alternative is available within the same store, or at other stores, with clear highlights of areas for improvement. This reduces uncertainty, saves time when comparing products, and makes hidden or difficult-to-read product information accessible. The result is a more informed consumer who discovers new, better-suited products with a single click.

# Objective Problems
## Experience
- Comparing products from different stores is impossible.
- Comparing products from a single store is slow. Before you even consider an alternative, you've already forgotten the previous product.
## Uncertainty
- It's difficult to know which cheaper products are still good for the consumer.
- The user interface for product information on the packaging is inconsistent, with small fonts and often cumbersome, misleading users.
- Not all products are intuitive for the user due to product placement, the use of psychological colors in supermarkets, and other means. A uniform user interface on an electronic device eliminates these distractions from the information that really matters.
- Every store always has the best prices, but which one is actually the cheapest for the user's preferences?

# Features
## Core Features
### At Home
- View other people's reviews of a product and write your own.
- View the availability and alternatives of previously purchased products after scanning the product.
- Improve shopping lists based on the suggested alternatives.
- Become aware of product content and background when scanning.

### At Location
- If you've found an alternative yourself, you can scan it and see if it's actually a good option, and why or why not.
- Consult and check off your grocery/wish list.
- In-store route planner based on your shopping list.

## Requirements
### User Personalization
- The user has a set of regular stores, and the app primarily sticks to those but also suggests alternatives.
- The user has the option to set preferences for labels such as fair-trade, organic, Nutri-Score, etc.

### User Interaction
- User feedback to identify areas for product improvement so that other consumers are also informed.

| Lies | Daughter | 15 | Concerned about our planet and sympathetic to developing countries. She regularly protests for a better environment. |

## Prototypes
**Scenario 1:** At home

Mom is home and is just reading the empty cornflakes box from a well-known brand that she's about to throw away, while commenting on how unhealthy it is!

An immediate reaction from her son: "I never get anything, that's so delicious, I need that!"

Griet pulls out SwapWise and scans the box. In no time, she sees that this cornflakes brand is €1.54 cheaper than a store-brand version and have a slightly better nutritional score.

Now that shopping is on the topic, Lies joins in the conversation, reminding her mother of an earlier promise to buy fair-trade coffee and snacks.

So Griet toggled the Fair Trade and Organic filters, and the app updated the shopping list, highlighting what they could find at their local store and supermarket.

Griet herself loves a pot of yogurt, but she didn't like the one she had last week. She scanned the product and saw similar reviews about her experience, so she left one of her own. Then she looked under alternatives in the app and immediately found a healthy and inexpensive product.

**Scenario 2:** At the store

Griet got up and wanted to do all sorts of things today. It's a beautiful Saturday, but she still had to go shopping and she didn't have much time. Before getting in the car, she checked SwapWise and saw that she only needed to go to Colruyt today.

Once she arrived at Colruyt, she received a route suggestion to efficiently navigate from shelf to shelf, which was extremely helpful for navigating the crowded store.


The app provides a mini-map for easy navigation.

Griet spots an eco-friendly soap on her way, but the label is rather illegible and sounds like Chinese to her.

She scans the product and immediately sees a 4-star rating along with the product information, for example: "The bottle is biodegradable, but the cap is tricky." Griet likes the review and confirms that the price is accurate.

Lies wanted to go shopping with her and after Colruyt, asks to stop by the local fair-trade store. Once there, Griet craves chocolate and can easily check all the labels and nutritional information by scanning the product.

When they get home, Berend cried because Griet had bought the store brand. After a bite, it turned out to be tastier, and everyone was happy!
