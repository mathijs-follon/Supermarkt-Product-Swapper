# SwapWise, an Alternative Supermarket Product Finder
Final project for Hasselt University in the Designing Interactive Systems course.

# Description
This project describes a smart application that helps consumers to quickly and easily choose the best product based on their personal preferences. By scanning products, both at home and in the store, the user immediately gains insight into where the exact product or suitable alternatives are available, along with a price comparison and other labels that are important to the user. In the store, the app also shows whether a better alternative is available within the same store, or at other stores, with clear highlights of areas for improvement. This reduces uncertainty, saves time when comparing products, and makes hidden or difficult-to-read product information accessible. The result is a more informed consumer who discovers new, better-suited products with a single click.

# Objective Problems
## Experience
- Comparing products from different stores is impossible.
- Comparing products from a single store is slow. Before you even consider an alternative, you've already forgotten the previous product.
## Uncertainty
- It's difficult to know which cheaper products are still good for the consumer.
- The user interface for product information on the packaging is inconsistent, with small fonts and often cumbersome, misleading users.
- Not all products are intuitive for the user due to product placement, the use of psychological colors in supermarkets, and other means. A uniform user interface on an electronic device eliminates these distractions from the information that really matters.
- Every store always has the best prices, but which one is actually the cheapest for the user's preferences?

# Features
## Core Features
### At Home
- View other people's reviews of a product and write your own.
- View the availability and alternatives of previously purchased products after scanning the product.
- Improve shopping lists based on the suggested alternatives.
- Become aware of product content and background when scanning.

### At Location
- If you've found an alternative yourself, you can scan it and see if it's actually a good option, and why or why not.
- Consult and check off your grocery/wish list.
- In-store route planner based on your shopping list.

## Requirements
### User Personalization
- The user has a set of regular stores, and the app primarily sticks to those but also suggests alternatives.
- The user has the option to set preferences for labels such as fair-trade, organic, Nutri-Score, etc.

### User Interaction
- User feedback to identify areas for product improvement so that other consumers are also informed.
